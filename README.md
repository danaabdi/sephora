# 📦 Sephora Product Returns Analytics

This project analyzes Sephora's product return operations with the goal of improving customer satisfaction, supplier evaluation, and inventory efficiency. Inspired by my own frequent Sephora purchases, I turned this business problem into a data warehouse and BI capstone project.

## 🎯 Objective

To help Sephora optimize its return policy by:
- Tracking and visualizing return trends by product, tier, and channel
- Evaluating supplier quality and contract risk
- Identifying resalable vs. damaged products
- Supporting better inventory restocking decisions

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- SQL (for KPI queries)
- SAP Data Warehouse Cloud (DWC) for dimensional modeling
- Tableau for dashboard visualization
- ETL pipeline design for data cleansing and loading
